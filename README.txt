Dump's Lightroom preview files to JPG's, without using the catalog or preview catalog.

This is useful if you have some or all previews but do not have the catalog to use existing programs.

Because no catalog is available, the dumped files do not include any metadata or even correct file names.  
To try to provide some info, a date and time is created from the PREVIEW date, which is probably the 
last time you edited, not the time from the image creation, but it is something.  Also, because 
there is no catalog the orientation (rotation) is not known so you will have to flip them left, right, 
etc.

You can build the executable from source, or download the executable provided.

The latest 64 bit executable is shown in the top level folder, you can just download it and run.
Sorry, I didn't build 32 bit.
